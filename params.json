It won't look like much, the project is meant to \r\nbe fairly general and independent of any real content. Anyhow, it can be seen \r\nhere:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.robhilgefort.com/rjh/starter/demo/\r\n\r\nIt is almost certainly not up to date with the latest changes from my \r\ndevelopment unit. There you will find a mirror of what has been committed to \r\nthe repo. The demo could be broken at any given time, but check it out, maybe \r\nit will be functional.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.robhilgefort.com/rjh/starter/src/\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSure, if you want.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
