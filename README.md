Site Foundations :: Bootstrap Twig README
========================================

This project is aimed at allowing rapid development using Bootstrap and 
Twig as a foundation

Demo
----

The demo exists in the demo folder and is a sample output from the project 
being executed on a server. It won't look like much, the project is meant to 
be fairly general and independent of any real content. Anyhow, it can be seen 
here:

It is almost certainly not up to date with the latest changes from my 
development unit. There you will find a mirror of what has been committed to 
the repo. The demo could be broken at any given time, but check it out, maybe 
it will be functional.
